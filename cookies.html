    <p></p>
    <li>Grab the dough from the spoon and using a rolling motion roll the dough into a ball. While doing this preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
    <li>Line a baking tray and repeat steps 1-2 in this section until you have around 6 evenly sized balls. Then space them out around 1.5-2 inches away from each other on your lined baking tray.</li>
    <li>Bake for around 8-10 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit. <strong>(Warning: Cook time can vary from cookie size).</strong></li>
    <li><strong>(Optional step)</strong> Every 4-6 minutes with oven mittens grab the tray and drop the tray back down. (This will flatten the cookie's air bubble that is formed from baking). This will provide a more flat cookie.
